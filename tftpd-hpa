apt-get update
apt-cache search tftpd
sudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa.
sudo service tftpd-hpa status
netstat -a | grep tftp



Configuration


sudo cp /etc/default/tftpd-hpa /etc/default/tftpd-hpa.ORIGINAL

Then, edit the tftpd-hpa configuration file.

sudo vi /etc/default/tftpd-hpa

and change the line that reads...

TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"

to

TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure --create"

odify Permissions on TFTP Root Directory
The root directory where files must be stored in order to access them via TFTP is /var/lib/tftpboot. If you want to be able to upload to that directory, then perform the following command.

sudo chown -R tftp /var/lib/tftpboot
Restart the tftpd-hpa Service
To make the changes take effect, the tftpd-hpa service must be restarted. This can be accomplished by performing the following command.

sudo service tftpd-hpa restart
At this point you should now have a TFTP server that allows you to both download and upload files.

Additional Information
tftpd-hpa seems to be somewhat tied to traditional tftpd. For more information try...

man tftpd
